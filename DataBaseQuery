This is a PHP script which will take input from a form and on the basis of 
that query a database and then display the data in a HTML table. The form
will offer the user a choice of fields to sort the data by as well as whether
they want the data to be sorted in ascending or descending order.

Include an external PHP script which contains functions used to connect to 
the database.
